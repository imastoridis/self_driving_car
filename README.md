# Neural Network and Machine Learning - Self driving car

### This is an implementation of a neural network designed to teach a car to avoid collisions.
   
The car is controlled by a neural network that learns from its mistakes using the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_reinforcement_learning">Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>
            technique.
       
To train it, reload the page until the car starts avoiding the first red car.
       
Then click the save button (to lock in that simulation) and reload the page until your car does better. Save every simulation that is better than before and reload until your car can avoid all collisions.
